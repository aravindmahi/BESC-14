features derived from the PSL vocabulary to opinion polls. All values shown are percentages. Observe that in all but the Colombian election, the PSL vocabulary provides
a better estimate of the vote share of the candidate.}

We adapt one basic forecasting algorithm from current literature to evaluate the
performance of our expanded vocabularies. We emphasize that our focus in this paper is
not on election forecasting per se but an interesting byproduct of our algorithm is that
it provides useful features for election forecasting.
To evaluate this aspect, we develop
a regression approach
to
learn a mapping
from tweet features (more below) to opinion polls, and thus forecast elections. 
this approach is adapted from \cite{bermingham2011using} and \cite{o2010tweets}.

We reason that by regressing from Twitter-derived features to the opinion polls mitigates bias caused by Twitter being a non-representative sample.
We use a total of six features: Klout scores, number of unique users, total number of mentions, sentiment, and incumbency. The Klout score measures an author's influence to dirve action on a scale from 1 to 100. The sentiment is scored from -20 to 20 to rate the positive or negative assertion associated with the tweet. The incumbency is a binary variable to indicate whether the candidate is the existing holder of the political office. Moreover, the Klout scores, unique users, and mentions are further categorized into positive and negative mentions.
Using our expanded vocabularies to suitably apportion tweets across the candidates,
we normalize each of these features to obtain the relative share of the volume. 
When there is more than one polling house publishing an opinion poll (for the same date) we take the average of the polls. 

\noindent
{\bf Performance:}
The model was tested exhaustively on a total of ten presidential elections from Latin America during 2012 and 2014. We run the prediction model in two different setting: one using the 
seed words and the other using PSL query expansion.
As outlined in the methodology earlier, only tweets geocoded to the specific location were
used to developed predictions for that location.
Table~\ref{table:trackRecord} shows the overall performance of the regression model under two settings. For each election, we predict the percentage of votes
gathered by each candidate. The error rate is calculated as the difference between the predicted
percentage and the actual polled percentage.
In all cases except the Colombia election, the PSL methodology described here gave a better
estimate of the vote share, in many cases within a margin of 5\%.
