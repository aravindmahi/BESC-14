\section{Discussion}
We have demonstrated a novel query expansion methodology using PSL and illustrated how a suitably
inferred vocabulary can provide significant gains in forecasting performance for elections.
Although
we have used elections to demonstrate performance gains, we believe that the
dynamic query expansion system is general and can be applied to more domains.
In future work, we aim to more finely model information about electoral demographics and study
interactions both at the group and at the individual level. We also intend to use labeled data to learn
PSL programs (both structure and probabilities). Finally, we aim to use the framework presented
here as a platform to investigate theories of how social groups participate and influence elections.
