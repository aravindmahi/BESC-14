\section{Discussion}
We have demonstrated a novel query expansion methodology using PSL and illustrated our method could correctly capture the evolving election related vocabularies during the election season.
We believe that the dynamic query expansion system is general and can be applied to not only in election but also in a lot of other domains. In future work, we aim to model information about electoral demographics in finer granularity and study interactions both at the group and at the individual level. We also intend to use labeled data to learn
PSL programs (both structure and probabilities). Finally, we aim to use the framework presented
here as a platform to investigate theories of how social groups participate and influence elections.
