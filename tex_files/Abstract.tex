As a surrogate data source for many real-world phenomena, social media
such as Twitter can yield key insight into people's behavior and their
group affiliations and memberships. 
As a phenomenon unfolds
on Twitter, the language, hashtags, and vocabulary used to describe it
evolves over time so that it is difficult to {\it a priori} capture the composition
of a social group of interest using static keywords. Capturing such dynamic
compositions is crucial to both understanding the true membership of social groups
and in providing high-quality data for downstream applications such as trend
forecasting. 
We propose a novel unsupervised learning algorithm that
builds dynamic vocabularies using probabilistic soft logic (PSL), a framework for probabilistic reasoning over 
relational domains. Using 10 presidential elections from eight countries
of Latin America (Mexico, Venezuela, Ecuador, Paraguay, Chile, Panama, 
Colombia, and Honduras), we 
demonstrate how our vocabulary discovery approach
helps capture dynamic trends specific to each election. The ability to grow a vocabulary
concurrently with social media trends helps capture key milestones in election
campaigns.
